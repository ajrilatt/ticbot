# ticbot
The goal of this project was to train a neural net to play tic-tac-toe. I decided to implement this by training the net to predict the eventual-winner of a given tic-tac-toe board. However, I'm also lazy, and couldn't be bothered to sit around and play tic-tac-toe against a friend for several hours. Instead, another program uses all available CPU cores to play itself in tic-tac-toe using random moves. My hope was that the overwhelming superiority of data quantity would allow the net to recognize advantageous spots. That didn't work out as well as I had hoped, as the model has about 70% accuracy by the midpoint of a game. In the future, I might try to implement a generative adversarial network that learns by self-play.
